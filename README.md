# AppiumDesktopDemo

## This is a simple demonstration of using Appium to write automated tests. The application being tested is the Windows 10 Calculator application.

### __Appium requires__
##### (1) Windows 10 is in "Developer Mode"
##### (2) WinAppDriver.exe is installed on the system being tested
##### (3) A software engineer

### __What can Appium test__
